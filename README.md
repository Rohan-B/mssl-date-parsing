# mssl-date-parsing
Comparing the accuracies of various text based date parsing libraries in Python for UCSD's Center for Peace and Security Studies.

1. Dateparser Python Library seems to be the winner so far, can handle multiple
languages but can't handle BC dates
2. Maya is also very solid at handling textual dates in English but can not
deal with other languages or handle BC dates (but they do get converted into
the same date in AD).
